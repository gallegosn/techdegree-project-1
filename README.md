# techdegree-project-1
 My First Techdegree Project

I am going for a exceeds expectations grade on this project. I did my best to comment my code to explain each function in detail.

I left in some commented out console log code to show how I checked my work through out the project. If necessary I can easily remove it.

There are 5 random quotes that cycle through on their own. The background color also changes when a new quote appears (either by clicking or waiting or refreshing the page.) One quote has a tag property as requested in the rubric.

The credit for the change background color function goes to another student CameronMHall which I found when I reveiewed his repository for project 1.
